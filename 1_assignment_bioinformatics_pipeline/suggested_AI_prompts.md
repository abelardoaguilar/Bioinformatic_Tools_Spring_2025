# **Proposed Pipeline Structure with Enhanced Exploration and Visualization**

## 📓 Part 1: Sequence Analysis Pipeline (Jupyter Notebook)

### ✅ **Step 1: Loading Sequences**

- **Aim:** Load and inspect nucleotide sequences.
- **Inputs:** `sequences.fna`
- **Outputs:** List of `SeqRecord` objects.

**AI Prompt:**
> "Write Python code using BioPython to load sequences from a fasta file (`sequences.fna`). Explore and verify the loaded objects by printing the first few sequence IDs, lengths, and sequence snippets."

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Compute and Visualize Basic Sequence Properties**

- **Aim:** Calculate length and GC content for exploratory data analysis.
- **Input:** List of `SeqRecord` nucleotide sequences.
- **Output:** pandas DataFrame (`properties.csv`), distribution plots (`lengths.png`, `gc_content.png`).

**AI Prompt:**
> "Generate Python code (with BioPython and pandas) to compute and visually explore sequence length and GC content. Provide exploratory visualizations (e.g., histograms or boxplots) and clearly document the DataFrame generated."

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Translate Sequences and Explore Protein Products**

- **Aim:** Translate nucleotide sequences into proteins, verify translation correctness.
- **Input:** List of nucleotide sequences (`SeqRecord`).
- **Output:** List of protein sequences (`SeqRecord`).

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Write code to translate nucleotide sequences into proteins, creating new `SeqRecord` objects. Verify correctness by printing translated protein sequences (partial sequences), their IDs, and amino acid lengths."

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Multiple Sequence Alignments (Nucleotide and Protein Level)**

- **Aim:** Perform multiple sequence alignments to identify conserved and variable regions.
- **Input:** Protein sequences (`SeqRecord` list).
- **Output:** Alignment files, visual exploration of alignment.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Generate Python code using BioPython (or Clustal Omega/MUSCLE) to perform multiple sequence alignments on protein sequences. Clearly visualize the alignment output with a simple consensus plot highlighting conserved regions."

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Pairwise Sequence Alignment + Distance Matrix + Heatmap Visualization**

- **Aim:** Compute pairwise sequence distances to explore sequence similarity/diversity, cluster sequences, and visualize relationships via heatmap.
- **Input:** Protein sequences (list of `SeqRecord` objects).
- **Output:** Pairwise distance matrix, clustering, heatmap visualization.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Write Python code that performs pairwise protein sequence alignments (using BioPython or `pairwise2`), computes similarity/distance scores, clusters sequences using hierarchical clustering, and visualizes the results as a heatmap using seaborn or matplotlib. Clearly comment on the rationale: visualizing pairwise distances helps reveal clusters of related sequences and outliers."

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Phylogenetic Tree Construction and Visualization**

- **Aim:** Identify evolutionary relationships and visualize phylogeny.
- **Input:** Aligned sequences.
- **Output:** Phylogenetic trees (`.nwk` files), visualization plots.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Provide Python code to construct a phylogenetic tree from aligned protein sequences using BioPython. Generate and visualize the tree, clearly annotating and exploring branch patterns visually."

---

### ✅ **Step 6: Function and Organism Prediction (BLAST/HMM)**

- **Aim:** Assign putative biological functions and organisms of origin.
- **Input:** Protein sequences (`SeqRecord` objects).
- **Output:** pandas DataFrame summarizing functions and organisms.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Create Python code performing BLAST searches against public databases and/or HMM searches to predict possible functions and organisms of origin for the given proteins. Document your results clearly in an explored pandas DataFrame, including visualizations summarizing organism frequency distributions."

## 📐 **Part 2: Structure Analysis (ChimeraX Script)**

### ✅ **Step 1: Load Protein Structures into ChimeraX**

- **Aim:** Load and visually confirm protein structure predictions.
- **Input:** AlphaFold-generated `.pdb` files.
- **Output:** Protein structures loaded in ChimeraX.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Write a clear ChimeraX Python script that loads all AlphaFold-generated `.pdb` files from a given directory. Include commands to visually inspect these loaded structures clearly by setting distinct colors and orientations."

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Structural Alignments and Visualization in ChimeraX**

- **Aim:** Align structures, assess structural homology, visualize similarities, and quantify relationships.
- **Input:** Loaded protein structures in ChimeraX.
- **Output:** Structural alignments, RMSD metrics, clear visualization screenshots (`.png`), and tabular results.

**AI Prompt:**  
> "Create a ChimeraX Python script that aligns multiple loaded protein structures, calculates pairwise structural similarity scores, visually explores alignments with clear images, and exports the quantitative results to a CSV file for reproducibility."

## 📢 **Recommended Next Steps:**

- Proceed incrementally, testing each step thoroughly before progressing.
- Regularly visualize and explore intermediate results to ensure correctness.
- Document the class and structure of each object clearly in your notebook to maintain traceability.
